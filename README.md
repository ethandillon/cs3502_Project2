# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Comparison
 CS3502 | Operating Systems | Ethan Dillon

Simulates and compares Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) and  Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) CPU scheduling algorithms.


## How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 downloaded

1.  Save the main.py file as a Python file (e.g., `scheduler.py`).
2.  Open a terminal in the file's directory.
3.  Run the script using:
    ```bash
    python scheduler.py
    ```
    *(Use your actual filename if different)*

## Alternatively: 

1. Copy the code from main.py.
2. Go to https://www.online-python.com/
3. Paste the code in the ide.
4. Press the "run" button.

## Interaction

* The script asks for the number of processes.
* Then, it asks for the Arrival Time and Burst Time for each process.
* Finally, it outputs simulation logs, execution details, process metrics, and a performance comparison for both algorithms.
